## Overview
Like the [Mp3Player](https://github.com/p1387h/CsPlayer) this project was mainly focused on learning / getting a glimpse at a new technology, which in this case was .Net Core. SignalR is used for the main communication between the desktop client and the server while it is also possible to request information by calling certain controllers in the backend.
